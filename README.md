## Files Included

- **`app.py`**: The main Streamlit application file for running the recommendation system.
- **`movie_hindi.pkl`**: Pickle file containing the trained recommendation model.
- **`hindi_model.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook used to train the recommendation model.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory.

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   Set up a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies.

3. **Install Required Packages**

   Generate a `requirements.txt` file if it does not already exist by freezing your environmentâ€™s current packages. Install the packages listed in `requirements.txt` using your package manager.

4. **Run the Streamlit Application**

   Execute the Streamlit application script to start the recommendation system.

5. **Access the Application**

   Open your web browser and go to the local URL provided by Streamlit to interact with the application.

## Model Details
